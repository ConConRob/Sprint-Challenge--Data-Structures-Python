Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
   constant (1)
2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
   constant (1)
3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
   # first solution
   Linear because of how it checks for None. This could get done better
   # second solution
   Constant
4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

   # first solution

   linear

   # second solution

   linear
